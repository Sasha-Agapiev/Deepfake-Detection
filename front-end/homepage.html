      <h1><b>About DDS</b></h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"> <i>The days of newspapers and tabloids are long gone. </i><br><br>
      Nowadays, the great majority of people get their news and information from online sources, 
      but unfortunately not all of this information is authentic. Recent technological breakthroughs
      have made it easier for misinformation to spread online with no way for internet users to protect
      themselves. <br> <br>
      As college students who lived through the age of online classes and the Zoom University experience,
      we are all too aware of this trend. This is why we decided to create the Deepfake Detection System. 
      By simply creating an account our Chrome extension platform, we give you the ability to verify the authenticity of any kind of digital 
      image in a matter of seconds. Our backend technology uses the latest
      machine learning strategies to calculate the likelihood of a picture being a deepfake, so that you can continue to 
      browse in peace without the looming fear of getting misled. <br>

      <h1><b>How To Use DDS</b></h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"> To use our system, you should first create or sign-in to your account using your email credentials. 
      Onced signed in, you should be directed to the home page (the page you're currently on) which gives you access to two main tools: 
      "Upload an Image" and "Report a Website". <br> <br> With the upload image button, you can upload any .png or .jpg file from your computer 
      and get a deepfake likelihood estimation within a matter of seconds. This estimation is a percentage which tells you the percentage
      likelihood of your image being a deepfake, so a low percentage means your image is most likely authentic. <br> <br>
      With the report website button, you will be directed to a form that lets you enter the domain URL of any website that you believe
      is distributing deepfake content. If enough people report the same website, it will be registered as harmful in our database and 
      you will receive a popup warning every time you visit this website in the future (only if you have website warnings turned on in your
      account settings). If you believe that a website has been flagged incorrectly, you can submit a request to have its flagged status 
      removed by clicking the button below and our team will take a look at the situation.</h5>
